# TwitKit

These are some Python tools I've written for interacting with the Twitter website. You will need to provide your own API key and access token to use the scripts here. If you do not already have an API key, you'll have to sign up for [a developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).

**twitter_random.py** -- Picks a random user from a text file (either generated by twitter_update_followers.py, or you can provide your own) and opens their Twitter page in the default web browser.

**twitter_update_following.py** -- Usng the Twitter APIs, retrieves a list of the people you are currently following and stores them in a text file. *(API keys required.)*
