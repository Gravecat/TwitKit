# TwitKit

These are some Python tools I've written for interacting with the Twitter website. You will need to provide your own API key and access token to use the scripts here. If you do not already have an API key, you'll have to sign up for [a developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).
